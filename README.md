# LudumDare37 - The Shack

'The Shack' is an old-school text adventure created for the ludum dare 37 game jam.
The entry can be found here: http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-37/?uid=44894


The plot:  
You wake up in a small room. 
You don't know where you are or who did this to you. 
The only thing you know is: 
You don't really want to be here.  

Find your way out of this Text Adventure and escape the room that imprisons you. 
Most of the things you can interact with are color coded but some you must find out by yourself.
